Phase 1: Project Planning and Ethical Approval
Step 1: Define the Model's Scope and Research Questions

Specify the Model's Purpose: Clearly articulate what phenomenon your SEDPNR model will simulate (e.g., the spread of a new idea, the adoption of a technology, or a health-related behavior). This will determine what your β and γ parameters represent.

Formulate Research Questions: What are you trying to learn? Examples might include:

"How do varying distributions of personality traits in a population influence the overall rate of adoption?"

"What is the impact of targeted interventions (e.g., messaging tailored to a specific personality type) on the simulation's outcome?"

Step 2: Secure Ethical Approval and Funding

Submit an Ethics Application: Prepare a detailed application for your university's Institutional Review Board (IRB) or ethics committee. Your proposal must include:

Informed Consent: A clear statement for participants explaining the purpose of the study, data usage, and their right to withdraw.

Data Anonymization and Security: A robust plan for ensuring participant data is anonymized and stored securely, especially since you are collecting sensitive personality information.

Justification: Explain the scientific and societal value of the research to justify the collection of personal data.

Phase 2: Data Collection and Psychological Measurement
Step 3: Design the Survey Instrument

The Big 5 Core: Use the 50-item IPIP-NEO-PI scale as your primary measure for the Big 5 personality traits.

Demographics: Include questions to capture key demographic data for Ireland's population pyramid (e.g., age, gender, region, education level).

Behavioral Proxies: Add questions that act as proxies for the behaviors you're modeling. For example, if β is a "risk-taking" parameter, include questions about willingness to try new things or engage in risky activities. This data will be crucial for the IPC regression.

Step 4: Execute the Survey

Recruit 1,000 Participants: Recruit a diverse sample of 1,000 individuals from the target population of Ireland.

Stratified Sampling: To align with Ireland's population pyramid, use a stratified sampling approach. This means ensuring your participant numbers for each age group (e.g., 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, etc.) are proportional to their representation in the country's population.

Data Collection: Administer the survey online using a secure platform, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.

Phase 3: Data Analysis and Parameterization
Step 5: Process and Analyze Survey Data with Item Response Theory (IRT)

IRT Application: Instead of using simple sum scores, use an IRT model (e.g., a graded response model) to process the raw survey responses.

Latent Trait Scores: The output of the IRT analysis will be a more precise, continuous score for each of the five personality traits for every one of your 1,000 participants. This will form the foundation of your agent's unique personality profile.

Step 6: Model the Relationship between Personality and Model Parameters using IPC Regression

IPC Regression Framework: Use your behavioral proxy questions from the survey and the IRT-derived personality scores as inputs for the IPC Regression.

Quantify Contributions: The output will be a function that quantifies the unique contribution of each personality trait to the individual's β and γ values. This moves beyond simple correlation to a predictive model of parameter variation.

For example: β 
individual
​
 =c+(w 
Openness
​
 ×Openness Score)+(w 
Conscientiousness
​
 ×Conscientiousness Score)+... where 'c' is a baseline and 'w' are the weights derived from the regression.

Phase 4: Agent-Based Model (ABM) Construction
Step 7: Build the Agent-Based Model (ABM)

Agent Initialization: Create a digital population of agents for your simulation.

Agent Population Size: This will be much larger than your 1,000 survey participants (e.g., 50,000 to 100,000 agents).

Stochastic Generation: For each agent, stochastically generate a personality profile (Big 5 scores) that statistically reflects the distributions (mean, standard deviation) you found in your 1,000-person survey, stratified by age.

Parameter Assignment: For each agent, use the function from your IPC Regression (Step 6) to assign a unique, individual β and γ value.

SEDPNR State Machine: Define the states of your model (e.g., Susceptible, Exposed, Decided, Procrastinating, Not Adopting, Recovered) and the transition rules between them. These transitions will be governed by each agent's individual β and γ values.

Step 8: Calibrate the Model using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)

Define Target Data: Obtain real-world, time-series data for the phenomenon you're modeling (e.g., weekly adoption rates, spread of a rumor).

Set up the GA: Use a Genetic Algorithm to tune any remaining unmodeled parameters (e.g., the overall strength of social influence, baseline transition rates not explained by personality).

DTW as the Fitness Function: The GA will run simulations with different parameter sets. The fitness of each simulation run will be determined by how well its output matches the real-world time-series data. Use DTW to compute the distance between the simulation's output and the target data, providing a robust measure of fit that accounts for temporal shifts.

Phase 5: Analysis and Interpretation
Step 9: Run Simulations and Perform Sensitivity Analysis

Simulate Diverse Scenarios: Run your model under various scenarios (e.g., with different starting conditions, different social network structures, or different policy interventions).

Sensitivity Analysis: Systematically vary the key parameters (e.g., the weights from your IPC regression) to understand which factors have the greatest impact on the outcome. This helps determine which personality traits are most influential.

Step 10: Use iGSS for Deeper Insight (Optional but Recommended)

Explore Agent Rules: Use iGSS to reverse-engineer agent behaviors that could have produced a specific observed outcome. This can help you validate your findings from the IPC regression and discover alternative agent rules that might be equally plausible.

Step 11: Validate and Report Findings

Validation: Compare your model's predictions to a separate, independent dataset to assess its predictive accuracy.

Disseminate Results: Report your findings, emphasizing how the heterogeneous, personality-informed approach provides new insights that a traditional, homogenous model could not. Highlight how your model can be used to design more targeted, effective interventions for specific personality types within the population.
