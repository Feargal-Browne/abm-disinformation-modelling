# Notes on Fractional Derivative Implementation:
# The current `fractional_derivative_operator` is a conceptual stand-in.
# For a robust implementation of fractional derivatives (Caputo or Riemannâ€“Liouville),
# a dedicated Python library such as `fde` (Fractional Differential Equations) or `fracdiff`
# would be necessary. These libraries provide numerical solvers for fractional differential equations.
# The `_ode_system` method would then need to be adapted to use these solvers,
# potentially by defining the fractional operators for each state variable.
# Example (conceptual, syntax may vary by library):
# from fde.operators import Caputo
# ...
# dS_i_dt_alpha = Caputo(alpha_S, S_i_func)(t)
# ...
# This will significantly increase computational complexity and require careful handling of initial conditions and memory effects.

# Notes on Parameter Initialization:
# The `agent_params` are currently randomly generated.
# In the full pipeline, these parameters (beta_i, sigma_i, rho_i, p_i_D_to_P, gamma_i_P_to_R, eta_i)
# will be derived from the Item Response Theory (IRT) analysis and Individual Parameter Contribution (IPC) regression
# based on the survey data (personality traits, values, and behavioral proxies).
# The `SEDPNRModel` class is designed to accept these pre-calculated agent-specific parameters.

# Notes on Network Generation:
# The `network_adj_matrix` is currently a dummy random matrix.
# For a scale-free network, a dedicated network generation algorithm (e.g., Barabasi-Albert model)
# from libraries like `networkx` would be used. The network structure should also incorporate
# community structure (e.g., hierarchical stochastic block model) and multiplex layers as described
# in `pasted_content.txt`.
# Edge weights (w_ij) would be assigned based on network size, tie strength, and platform.
