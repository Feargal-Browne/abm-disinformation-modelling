Conceptual framework for a fractional derivative solver.

This module provides a conceptual framework for a fractional derivative solver.
It includes a placeholder class for Adams-Moulton weights, which is used by
the SEDPNR model. The actual implementation of a robust FDE solver is
beyond the scope of this script and would require a dedicated library.

# --- IMPORTANT NOTE ON FRACTIONAL DERIVATIVE IMPLEMENTATION ---
# Implementing a robust and efficient fractional derivative solver for a system
# of coupled differential equations like SEDPNR is a highly complex task.
# Standard ODE solvers (like scipy.integrate.odeint) are not designed for FDEs.
# This file provides a *conceptual* framework and a *simplified numerical approximation*
# for demonstration. For a truly accurate and stable solution, a dedicated FDE library
# or a custom numerical scheme (e.g., Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method for FDEs)
# would be required, which is beyond the scope of a direct, simple integration.
# The `differint` and `pyfod` libraries offer some numerical methods for fractional
# derivatives, but integrating them into a system of coupled FDEs often requires
# re-framing the problem or using their specialized FDE solvers.
